            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving read in Hiſtories, that the gates of <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> were larger then the City, I purpoſe to avoid ſuch an <hi>indecorum:</hi> for I will not make a large porch to a ſmall build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor premiſe a long Preface to a ſhort Treatiſe. Onely in brief I ſhall premiſe two Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I am not ignorant that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have gone before me, and in ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate volumes have treated on this ſubject of <hi>Contentment:</hi> I ſhall not be diſcouraged to follow after thoſe Authours (though I am ſenſible that I come ſhort of them; yet) I will caſt my mite into the Treaſury, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb facs="tcp:54619:4"/> that a willing mind, and a real deſire of doing good may obtain accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God and men. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Diſcourſe I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly inſiſted on a plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous method. And although the Doctrine of Contentment is the <hi>To</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this Tract, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authours, both they and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the ſubſtantials thereof, yet as to the manner of handling of this Doctrine, I inſiſt onely on my own method, neither do I plow with any other mans heiſer; but what I treat on, hath coſt me much pains in my retired meditations (though I am willing to learn of any.) What I here treat on I know experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be true, and my deſire and endeavour is to comfort others with theſe particular comforts, wherewith I my ſelf have been comforted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning <hi>the Doctrine of Contentment</hi> which is here treated
<pb facs="tcp:54619:4"/> on, it is a rare, excellent and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Leſſon,</hi> which can be never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough taught, and never enough learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The book of Nature cannot teach it exactly, we muſt therefore have recourſe unto the Book of Scripture, where onely it is exactly taught. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are in the dark, and their lamps twinkle; we muſt go to ſchool to Chriſt, and to his Apoſtles, who teach us this great Leſſon. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpirit is not an herb which grows in our gardens: it is a plant of our heavenly Father's plantation, and it is onely watered by the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit of God. To make God <hi>our portion,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 57. Lam. 3. 24.</note> as the Church profeſſeth, <hi>The Lord is my portion.</hi> To learn (as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> did) <hi>in every eſtate to be content: <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 11.</note> To <hi>caſt our care upon God who careth for us</hi> (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> exhorts,) <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 7.</note> This is the right and onely way to render our lives comfortable, and to make us
<pb facs="tcp:54619:5"/> live a heaven upon earth. I will not (that I may keep my promiſe) detain thee Candid Reader, with a long preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary diſcourſe. I heartily wiſh thy profitting by what thou readeſt: and if thou profit by reading of this Diſcourſe, (which my hearts deſire is that thou mayeſt) give God the glory and praiſe of all, and help him in thy prayers, who commends thee to Gods gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and is deſirous of the employment, to be,</p>

It's the diſcontented ſpirit of a man, that cauſeth him to eſteem a great eſtate but mean, becauſe his deſire is inſatiate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited: whereas a contented perſon is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch an excellent temper, that he eſteems a mean eſtate great, becauſe his mind is quieted, his affections are regulated, and his heart acquieſceth in the divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; ſo that riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all are the portion of a contented man: becauſe a contented man enjoys a ſacred communion with God, and he finds all in the Fountain which was wanting in the Ciſterns, and in the deficiency of all Creatures, he finds all made up in the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of God. Though ſuch a man may want, according to the worlds verdict, many outward accommodations, yet in his own judgement he poſſeſſeth them, or elſe what is better, and more worth then them all: for his heart reſts contented, and is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54619:16"/> abundantly ſatisfied with the good pleaſure of God. This man makes God his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and therefore hath all, as a Father ſaith, <hi>He hath all things, who hath him that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>

                  <p>To produce an Inſtance notoriouſly known; <hi>Ahab</hi>'s heart was ſet upon <hi>Naboth</hi>'s vineyard, he tendred very fair propoſals, either to give the price in money to the full value, or elſe by way of exchange to give another and a better vineyard. The vineyard of <hi>Naboth</hi> was near to the palace of <hi>Samaria,</hi> conveniently ſituated for <hi>Ahab</hi>'s accommodation; it lay near his Demeſnes:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54619:18"/> 
                     <hi>Naboth</hi> gave a flat and rational denial, 1 <hi>Kings 21. 3. And Naboth ſaid unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, The Lord forbid it me that I ſhould give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this anſwer <hi>Ahab</hi> took pet, refuſed his meat, laid him down upon his bed heavy and diſpleaſed, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Thus this diſcontented man was ſullen, and vext himſelf, becauſe he could not poſſeſs that which was not his own: his deſire was inordinate and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reſtleſs, ſo that he could not enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any thing elſe, becauſe his greedy deſire was not ſatisfied in that particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Naboth</hi>'s vineyard. Now let us take notice of the dreadful effects and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this diſcontented ſpirit. Upon this curſed root grew ſuch fruit as was more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then gall and wormwood. For firſt, to compaſs <hi>Naboth</hi>'s vineyard, <hi>Ahab</hi> gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the wicked counſels of his wife <hi>Jezabel,</hi> one who is ſtigmatized for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of women, for <hi>whoredoms and witchcrafts.</hi>

Hence followeth falſe-witneſs-bearing and falſe accuſations againſt the ninth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. <hi>Jezabel</hi> wrote in the Kings name, and ſealed the letter with the Kings ſignet. Religion was pretended, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but murder was intended. <hi>Naboth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 21. 13.</note> was accuſed of blaſphemy, and two ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> were ſuborned to give teſtimony to a falſe accuſation. Then thirdly followeth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54619:19"/> murder, a palpable breach of the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Naboth</hi> was ſtoned to death. And fourthly, after the murder committed upon the perſon of <hi>Naboth, Ahab</hi> came and took poſſeſſion of his vineyard; This was evident theft, a breach of the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Thus we ſee the gradations of ſin; covetouſneſs and diſcontent brought forth forgery and falſe accuſations; forgery and falſe accuſations brought forth murder, and murder brought forth theft &amp; robbery. The ſource and orignal of all was a covetous ſpirit, a greedy deſire in <hi>Ahab</hi> to get that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was not his own; and this deſire is unlawful. For any great man to impale the poor mans acre in his Park, and to incloſe the poor mans Cottage in a great mans Palace againſt the poor mans conſent, is abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both by the Law of God and man.</p>

But multitudes there are who make themſelves rich by rapine, oppreſſion and violence: and many there are who offend in an high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by cavilling in needleſs matters, who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54619:19"/> by forged cavillations, Ieſuitical colluſions and equivocations, and by variety of tricks and wit, ſeek to diſpoſſeſs the right owners out of their own inheritance. And others there are as bad as they, who to make more room for themſelves, and to maintain their own Grandeur, defraud many poor by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, Incloſures and depopulations. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are who rejoyce to build their own foundation upon the ruines of other men, and to rear up a ſtately Fabrick upon that place, where many houſes have been pull'd down, and many families have been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What do theſe deſign, and what other effects do follow, but a <hi>Babel</hi> of confuſion, and a ready way to ruine themſelves and their poſterity? Many ſo build houſes (ſuch I mean as get eſtates by rapine and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) as if their very ſtately houſes ſhould be places of their ſepulchres. Thoſe Scriptures are well known, (Oh! that they were as well laid to heart) One is <hi>Jer. 17. 11. As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> Another is <hi>Habak. 2. 9, 10, 11.

The ſtory in brief is this. <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour demoliſhed four Abbeys and thirty ſix Pariſh Churches in <hi>Hantſhire,</hi> and turned out the Inhabitants for thirty miles compaſs, to make a Foreſt for wild beaſts, (which Foreſt to this day is called New Foreſt.)

Merchandizing and buying and ſelling, trading and trafficking, commuting one thing for another by mutual conſent of the buyer and ſeller are not onely lawful but commendable. <hi>Abraham</hi> communed with <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> about the cave of <hi>Machpelah</hi> for a burying place. <hi>Ephron</hi> would have given it him, but <hi>Abraham</hi> would not take it upon gift; wherefore <hi>Ephron</hi> told him the value of the land to be worth four hundred ſhekels of ſilver, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> paid that ſum, <hi>v.</hi> 16.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It's both lawful and neceſſary for any</hi>

                     <hi>man to make a good improvement of what he poſſeſſeth of his own.</hi> And though probably at preſent ſome profits ariſing and accruing out of his eſtate are not yet viſible to him, yet he ought by good husbandry and a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal management of his eſtate to make it better, and what yet he hath not, to make
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54619:21"/> his own (as far as equity permits) by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and diligence. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The</hi>

It is ſaid <hi>with joy and with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart.</hi> God would have us enjoy the fruit of our labours with cheerfulneſs, and it is well pleaſing to God that we ſhould enjoy comfortably and cheerfully the outward things of this preſent life. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Here is a reaſon rendred: <hi>for God now accepteth thy work.</hi> (i. e.) It is well pleaſing to God for a man in the fear of God to labour diligently in the works of his calling, and to rejoyce in the bleſſing of God upon his labours. It is Gods acceptance of our work that expells anxiety and immoderate carefulneſs, and cauſeth joy and alacrity in the ſpirit. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this Scripture with <hi>Eccleſ. 3. 12, 13. I know there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoyce and to do good in his life time, and alſo that every man ſhould eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labours, it is the gift of God.</hi> Solomon gave his experimental
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54619:29"/> verdict of all earthly things; and gives this ſentence, that there is no good in them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man with Contentment rejoyce in Gods bleſſings and do good in his life time. For he reaps the fruits of his charity, and doth moſt good, who makes his own eyes his <hi>Overſeers,</hi> and his own hands his <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</hi> He that hath a large and a liberal heart to <hi>honour God with his ſubſtance,</hi> and <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 9. Eccleſ. 11. 1.</note> to <hi>caſt his bread upon the waters,</hi> and in the confluence of his riches to be doing of good, this is the man that enjoys the good of his labour. He ſeeth a good improvement of his charity, and he finds the benefit of it: for he enjoys the benefit of many prayers, and his own eyes ſee the rich increaſe of his charity. Contentment is a duty in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner enjoyned to ſouldiers. <hi>Luke 3. 14. And the ſouldiers demanded of John the Baptiſt ſaying, And what ſhall we do? And he ſaid unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſly, and be content with your wages.</hi> Violence, falſe accuſations and robbery, are as well to be avoided by ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as other men. For war is not to be ſought for it ſelf, nor is the life of a ſouldier a conſtant abiding trade, but therefore men go to war, that peace may be procured and right <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:54619:30"/> unto all, <hi>Hebr. 13. 5. Let your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> There are five negatives, which make in <note place="margin">

                  <p>A third and laſt miſchief (which I ſhall name) is this, That diſcontentedneſs of ſpirit is miſchievous to the ſoul; and ſuch a miſchief as redounds to the ſoul is the worſt miſchief of all. For it is an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented obſervation that of all perſons there is none who more prejudice their own ſouls, then male-contented perſons: when they are in a Congregation, where the Word is preached, the entanglements of the world do ſeiſe ſo much upon them, ſo that they heed no more what the Preacher ſaith then the ſeats whereon they ſit. Theſe auditours are of the ſame temper as thoſe were, of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. And they come unto thee as thy people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</hi> When they are admitted into conference with ſerious Chriſtians, by whoſe ſociety they might be gainers, then the cares of the world creep into their thoughts, and ſo diſturb them, inſomuch that all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54619:39"/> good diſcourſe is loſt upon them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like water ſpilt upon the ground, that cannot be gathered up again. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in their private prayers the world ſteps in, and diſtracts them in the performance of that duty. And when they ſhould in a ſolemn manner at the Lords Supper keep their thoughts to the great buſineſs in hand, then the world interpoſeth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts them from ſerious meditations. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chriſtians are ſenſible of theſe failings, and bewail them in their ſerious addreſſes to the throne of grace. Who is able to declare ſufficiently, how many are thoſe miſchievous conſequences which grow upon this root of diſcontent, which is a root of bitterneſs that brings forth nothing but gall and wormwood? It is evident by what hath been forementioned, that the body, eſtate and ſoul of a man are all exceedingly the worſe by reaſon of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſpirit.</p>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have food and raiment, and peradventure of the beſt and choiceſt in both kinds; yet they have not copied out this excellent leſſon of divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Hence the confluence of riches and honours, pleaſures and profits of the world are a heavy burden and vexation to them, becauſe they enjoy them not with a quiet and a cheerful mind. Now, that I may not ſtay in generals, I will propound particular inſtances, and ſo diſcover who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54619:40"/> are diſcontented and never ſatisfied, and ſo come within the verge of this Uſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All envious perſons are in an eſpecial <note place="margin">1 Envious perſons are diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons.</note> manner to be numbred amongſt diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons. For becauſe others are greater and richer, and in higher eſteem then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore they torment, vex and fret themſelves: this ſin the Pſalmiſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, <hi>Pſal. 37. 1.

Appoſite to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is the charge of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23. 17. <hi>Let not thine heart envy ſinners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi> The fear of God fixed in the heart is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means to root out this weed of envy. But where the fear of God is wanting, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy doth increaſe and multiply. Whoever therefore willingly allows himſelf in this grand ſin of envy, he can never enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor any thing he poſſeſſeth comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54619:41"/> for though he hath a liberal portion of earthly things, yet he is ſtill hankering after more, projecting and contriving vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ways, according to the dictates of his own fancy, how to add houſe to houſe, land to land, and one bag of gold or ſilver to another; and when he takes notice that ſome others are richer then himſelf, he envies and grudgeth them, and his heart riſeth againſt them; ſo that any mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is the <hi>eye-ſore</hi> of an envious man. If then we would learn this leſſon of divine Contentment, we ſhould pluck up root and branch this bitter and curſed weed of envy; for whereever envy grows, contentment cannot grow near it. Envy is ſo bad and miſchievous a neighbour, as it hates and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells contentment out of its coaſts. And contentment of ſpirit is ſo good a neighbour of it ſelf, as it neither deſires nor ſeeks after acquaintance and neighbourhood with envy. There is not a greater antipathy in nature between a wolf and a lamb, then there is in morality between an envious and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented perſon. Envy and Contentment are inconſiſtent, and cannot keep a mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy and correſpondence together: ſtill there will be claſhing and heart-burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Though <hi>Saul</hi> was a King, yet he could not enjoy himſelf contentedly, becauſe he envyed <hi>David</hi> for the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

If a proud opinionated man hear a plain powerful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he is not contented with the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel, his palate is vitiated, and he cannot reliſh wholeſom food; he cannot content himſelf with the form of ſound words; but he affects curioſities of humane inventions, fragments of Poets, gleanings of Comedians, and ſuch like traſh he prefers before plain edifying preaching: ſo then look upon a proud perſon upon any account whatever, you ſhall find him a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented man.</p>

Every one meets with one diſeaſe or other, as an alarm to warm him of the frailty and ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his life upon earth. When the ſtone, ſtrangury, cholick, gout, tooth-ach, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſuch other like diſtempers rage in their extremity, then patience, meekneſs and contentedneſs afford great help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to bear thoſe burdens with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility; for hereby the diſeaſe is more miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and leſs painful. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, raging, fretting and vexing under pains and anguiſh adds more fuel to the flame, and in ſtead of leſſening aggravates the grief more and more.

                     </gap>, or diſtinguiſhing ſigns, which diſcover a great difference between contented and diſcontented perſons, as I ſhall repreſent unto you in theſe enſuing particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A contented perſon is a charitable <note place="margin">1. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a charitable perſon.</note> perſon, open-handed, large-hearted and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral. As God hath given him a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhare of this worlds goods, ſo he communicates and diſtributes them to the ſupply of ſuch as are in a neceſſitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. He looks upon himſelf as a ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard in truſt, and therefore ingaged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to others that are in need, in feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, viſiting the impriſoned and relieving the diſtreſſed. God hath made as well the poor as rich: and the rich ought to open their hands and hearts for the relieving of the poor. The commands are very many to this purpoſe; onely I ſhall inſtance in two or three, one command is, <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 1, 2. Caſt thy bread upon the waters, and thou ſhalt find it after many days.</hi> In our old Engliſh tranſlation it is read, <hi>Caſt thy bread upon wet faces;</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the poor mans miſery cauſeth him to weep. Now charity beſtowed upon the poor is not loſt; it is like ſeed ſown, W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> will bring forth a plentiful harveſt. But ſome may complain of the times, and may fear that they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54619:51"/> themſelves may want. But this thought muſt not hinder charity. For v. 2. it is ſaid, <hi>Give a portion to ſeven and alſo to eight, for thou knoweſt not what evil ſhall be upon the earth.</hi> There is a certain definite number uſed for an uncertain and indefinite, implying the great extent of charity, that many ought to be made partakers of it. And though evils are foreſeen, and feared, yet whileſt we have this worlds goods, we ſhould take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity of doing good with them. Another command is, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17, 18. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, willing to communicate.</hi> In this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are many choice things obſervable, 1. There is a word of command, <gap reason="foreign">

To whom is this command given? I anſwer, it is <hi>to them that are rich in this world,</hi> ſuch as have the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of worldly goods, as gold and ſilver, corn, lands and revenues: Such as have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the good things of this life are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54619:52"/> not to hoord them up, but to diſtribute and do good. 3. Obſerve two obſtacles or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, which muſt be avoided.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is high-mindedneſs, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note place="margin">1. High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs hinders good works.</note> this is a grand impediment; it is all one with pride of heart, and it obſtructs the practice of charity: for proud perſons graſp all they can, and think all they have too little to ſatisfie their pride: and hence it comes to paſs, that many will beſtow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pounds in gorgeous apparel, and care not what they expend upon ridiculous and exotick garbs and faſhions, and in the mean time they grumble at a few pence ask'd of them towards the relief of ſuch, as are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty.</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and this implies liberality and beneficence. Not onely a bare doing of good, but in a bountiful manner. <note place="margin">Quò quiſque opibus abundat, eò amplior illi bene ficentiae materiae ſuppetit, &amp; quò ſemper ad erogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum pigriores ſumus quàm deceat, eò pluribus ver bis eam virtutem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                     </note> 2. To be <hi>rich in good works:</hi> not onely a doing good, but doing good in a plentiful manner is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. A niggardly giving for a rich man is here forbidden. 3. That they be <hi>ready to diſtribute,</hi> here is ſet forth a ready propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mind. 4. That they be <hi>willing to communicate.</hi> This is exegetical of the former; diſtributing and communicating are acts of charity. And ſuch as exerciſe theſe duties ſhall reap the comfortable fruit thereof. 1. <hi>Tim. 6. 19. Laying up in ſtore for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> From this Scripture Papiſts plead for merit, <note place="margin">Remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio non ex meriti rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one pendet, ſed ex libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali Dei acceptione. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                     </note> and <hi>Eſtius</hi> cauſeleſly blames <hi>Calvin,</hi> (as uſually Papiſts do) for ſaying (and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxly) <hi>That reward depends not on merit, but on Gods free acceptance.</hi> To this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture I will add one other, which may give
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54619:53"/> light to this, viz. <hi>Hebr. 13. 16. But to do good and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> So that here is neither merit in the work, nor in the worker, but it is Gods acceptance we muſt onely plead. For by what hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned appears, that acts of charity and contentedneſs of ſpirit joyn together in a mutual harmony. Let none therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that by a prudent and liberal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his goods to the neceſſity of others, that he ſhall be any whit a loſer: for God himſelf will be his paymaſter, <hi>Prov. 19. 17. He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given, will he pay him again.</hi> An open-handed man that is conſiderately charitable (for indiſcreet charity is culpable) is a bleſſed man, <hi>Pſal. 41. 1, 2. Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.</hi> When contentment and godlineſs go hand in hand, then charity puts forth it ſelf. For in teſtimony of thankfulneſs, a good man abounding in riches will abound in acts of charity, and diſperſe to the poor with a cheerful and willing mind, <hi>Pſal. 112. 9. He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor, his righteouſneſs endureth for ever.</hi> The fear of want and rolling diſturbing thoughts cauſe many to be ſo niggardly and cloſe-fiſted: But a man of a contented mind is induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54619:53"/> in his calling, thankful for what he hath, and therefore fears no want; but he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth with all cheerfulneſs acts of charity, and improveth the preſent ſeaſon, making his own eyes his overſeers, and his own hands his executours: for by doing good in his life time, he may to his comfort behold the good ſucceſs of his charity, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enjoy the benefit of the fervent and powerful prayers of many, who have fared the better by him, and whoſe loyns do bleſs him. Now a ready way to evidence the truth of our religion is to exerciſe works of mercy and compaſſion towards ſuch as are in want. Let not rich perſons be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that they ſhall miſcarry in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, for we read, <hi>Prov. 11. 25. The liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be watered alſo himſelf.</hi> Iſai. 32. 8. <hi>But the liberal deviſeth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral things, and by liberal things ſhall he ſtand.</hi>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the lands and revenues, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he poſſeſſeth are his own proper goods, and he is diligent to improve them, yet he orders all his affairs with moderation: as that man is blame-worthy, who is gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and eager in the purſuit after another mans eſtate; ſo is he to be blamed, who is over eager and ſolicitous for recovering of his own right. For inſtance, If a tenant have his barns fired by lightning, and his corn burnt up, or multitude of his cattel die of the rot (notwithſtanding the rigour of the law requires exact performance of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, yet) the landlord is obliged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſhew mercy and compaſſion.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54619:55"/> at ſea or at home, or variety of caſualties is reduced to a mean condition; yet this man looks at and acknowledgeth the hand of God, and without fretting or murmuring, and without reviling of ſecond cauſes, he patiently and ſubmiſſively undergoes his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and loſſes. When a man can part with that which God hath given him, and quietly reſigne that to God which he hath received from God, this ſhews much of a contented and patient ſpirit. Though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have their houſes burnt and their goods conſumed in the flames, yet there is great mercy in that they eſcaped with their lives, and the acting of thankfulneſs for ſo great a deliverance as this, ſhould ſilence all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring for the loſs of the other. We ſhould in deliberate thoughts all conſider, that all that we have and hold is in truſt from God, our great Lord and Creditour. The title, propriety and intereſt of all we are or have are in God alone; we onely are ſtewards, or <hi>uſu fructuarii.</hi> That God hath lent any of us an eſtate ſo long, is a great teſtimony of his bounty, and a great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to engage us to thankfulneſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not think hardly of God, nor murmure at God, for calling for his own again. For God is the abſolute Sovereign Lord and Owner of all; we are onely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at his will and pleaſure. God is our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54619:55"/> Maſter, we are his ſtewards and engaged to give an account, for all that which is committed to our truſt. <hi>Job</hi> is a pattern of patience, chap. 1. 21. <hi>The Lord gave</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> And when his wife gave him a croſs anſwer, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſel, he returns a wiſe anſwer, <hi>Job 2. 10. Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeaketh; what ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> He is a very bad debter, who grumbles and falls out with his creditour when he calls for his own. It oftentimes ſo falls out that the lender who in kindneſs hath lent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum of money, when he calls for it again, he loſeth a friend of the borrower: but this is a high piece of ingratitude, to be utterly abhorred. But he is a ſober and ſettled ſpirited man, and hath learned the leſſon of contentment, who is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne that up to God which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God. If he loſeth an eſtate by fire, robbery, decay of trading, ſhipwrack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he looks at the higheſt hand and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmits. He ſaid well who uſed this expreſſion, <hi>Non contriſtor quia recepiſti, ago gratias quòd dediſti.</hi> Whenever then loſſes, poverty or affliction befall us, when we are deprived of that which formerly we enjoyed, we muſt exerciſe two graces, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54619:56"/> patience in ſubmitting to Gods will, both for the preſent and future; and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for that eſtate which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſo long; and patience and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs are grand evidences of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                  <p>A fourth and laſt excellency of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">4.

In this reſpect
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54619:62"/> a man of a contented mind is richer then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and noble Perſonages; for they are not contented with a great deal, the other is contented with a little.

If we look for contentment in worldly things, we ſeek <hi>for the living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead.</hi> If we expect ſatisfaction in creatures, we ſhall meet with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by experience find an inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and deficiency in creatures, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to anſwer the deſires of our hearts.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A fifth conſideration to move us to contentment, ſhall be drawn; from the greatneſs of thoſe mercies which we enjoy, and the meanneſs and emptineſs of thoſe things which we want. We who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt have a right to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and covenant of grace. In Chriſt we have a ſtrong title unto them. We are of the <hi>church of the firſt-born,</hi> and of the <note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 23. Gal. 6. 10. 2 Cor. 6. 28. Rom. 8. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>houſhold of faith, ſons and daughters of God, heirs, and joynt heirs with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the ſerious conſideration of our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in theſe great things of eternity, may cauſe us to ſet a lower rate on theſe things of this preſent world. What is all the gold and ſilver, all the Eaſtern and Weſtern treaſures in compariſon of heavenly things? They are no better then traſh and vanity in compariſon of thoſe things which in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are reſerved for all true beleevers. Let us compare the riches of Chriſt, his purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of juſtification and ſanctification, and glorification, with the honours, profits and pleaſures of this preſent world, and we ſhall find that theſe tranſient and periſhing things are not worthy to be compared with thoſe durable things. We read that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the ſons of his concubines <hi>gifts,</hi> and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54619:65"/> ſent them away, but he gave the inheritance unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſon of the promiſe: ſo God gives outward gifts; as riches and honours to the men of the world, but the inheritance of heaven he reſerveth for his children. There is a notable ſtory of two men, one called <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the other called <hi>Didymus;</hi> This <hi>Didymus</hi> was a man eminent for parts and graces, but he was blind: <hi>Anthony</hi> asked him if he was not troubled for want of his eye-ſight; yes (ſaith he) I am, but ſhall I be troubled for the want of that which even dogs have, and ſhall I not rejoyce and be thankful for that I enjoy, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have? The application is obvious. A Chriſtian man thus expoſtulates with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Shall I be diſcontented and vex my ſelf for want of that which dogs have? They have bread and meat, and kennels to lodge in; and oft times the very dogs of ſome great Perſonages are fed with choicer food, and lie in better rooms then ſome good Chriſtians are accommodated withall: ſhall I not then be contented with that which makes Angels themſelves glorious? For this cauſe, the Apoſtle is exuberant in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Eph. 1. 3. Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſsings in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Chriſt.</hi> What then though a child of God hath not promotions in earthly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54619:66"/> yet if he have aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt, and an intereſt in heavenly places, this conſideration ſhould be an eſpecial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to contentment. A poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar lying in a Church-porch, read a lecture of contentment to a rich man: The rich man being much diſcontented and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, went on purpoſe to diſcourſe with a beggar lying in ſtraw in a Church-porch: the rich man wiſheth him a good morrow; he wondred what-he meant; then (ſaid he) I wiſh you a good day; Why, ſaith the beggar, do you wiſh me either good morrow or good day? for I never knew bad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor bad day in all my life, nor did I ever meet with one bad night. What is the reaſon ſaid the rich man? The poor man anſwered, when I was in a rich eſtate, I prayed always that petition in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> and now being in a poor condition, I pray the ſame prayer, <hi>Thy will be done;</hi> ſo nothing comes amiſs to me, becauſe I labour to ſubmit my will in all things to the will of God. If then we could imitate this man in all conditions, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring our wills in obedience and ſubjection to the will of God, we ſhould then be good practitioners in this excellent art of Contentment.</p>

I am ſure amongſt many there are three ſpecial aſſociats and boſom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of contentment, whoſe neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and acquaintance are much to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and prized, and they are faith, patience and heavenly-mindedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith is a companion of contentment. <note place="margin">1. Faith is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Faith and dependance on God is a ſpecial means to work the heart over to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper. For faith acting on the promiſes, with a ſtedfaſt recumbence on the Word of God, doth abundantly ſtay and quiet the hearts of Chriſtians, and ſupport and carry them with cheerfulneſs through the greateſt ſtorms of afflictions. A man faln into the water catcheth hold of any twig, any cord, or any hand to help him out: ſo though a Chriſtian be in a ſinking condition, yet if he can adhere to the divine promiſes, and act faith upon them, he will
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54619:67"/> be held up above water. It is unbelief which cauſeth ſo many tumultuous and vexatious thoughts in our hearts. Could we beleeve God, and truſt in him on his word, that he is faithful in all his promiſes, all-ſufficient, omnipotent, willing and able to relieve and help us, and that he is of tender bowels, full of compaſſion, a Father of mercies and a God of all conſolations; ſuch ſerious meditations as theſe would ſtifle all diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented thoughts in the conception, nip them in the bud, and cruſh them in their firſt motions. The more faith the more contentedneſs, and the more unbelief the more diſcontentedneſs. Faith acts upon a ground of experience, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Faith keeps a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever alive in dying times; it keeps the heart from fainting, <hi>Pſal. 27. 14. Wait on the Lord: Be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart, wait I ſay on the Lord.</hi> Whence ariſe diſcontented murmuring ſpeeches, but from unbelief? For unbelief is that root of bitterneſs which brings forth nothing, but gall and wormwood. When men are ſtraitned for outward things, they are exceedingly perplexed and troubled in their ſpirits; but when faith interpoſeth, it affords meat, drink and clothes; for a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54619:67"/> beleever truſts God with all, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts God his life and livelyhood, and all. How then doth a beleever live? the Prophet tells us, <hi>Hab. 2. 4. The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> For the excellency and uſefulneſs of this ſentence is ſo evident, as that it is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſeveral places of Scripture, and preſs'd home unto point of practice. When trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17. Gal. 2. 20. &amp; 3. 11. Hebr. 10. 38.</note> and vexations ariſe from thwarting paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of providence, faith ſteps in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns away with Trophies of victory, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 4. This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> When multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are perplexed and endangered, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the methods, wiles and variety of Satans temptations, then faith is to be made uſe of as a ſtrong ſhield, to ward off the blows, 1. <hi>Pet. 5. 9. Whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> In one word let it be ſpoken, that in all troubles, diſaſters and ſufferings, faith quiets the mind. Faith is like that meal, which being caſt into the pot, the wild gourds did no harm, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 42.</note> they were ſhred in the pot, yet as ſoon as the meal was put in, the pottage became wholeſom. Faith ſweetens the ſowreſt pills of afflictions, and becalms the ſpirit amidſt the ſharpeſt ſufferings. Yet we muſt with caution expreſs our ſelves. Faith that is genuine and of the right ſtamp, muſt be a purifying faith, and a working <note place="margin">Acts 15. 9. Gal. 5. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:54619:68"/> faith: and however <hi>Luther</hi> be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when he ſaith, <hi>Cavete à bonis operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi> he means that we muſt beware of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good works, ſo as to plead merit, and to expect ſalvation by them; he elſewhere gives this character of faith, <hi>Fides maxima &amp; heroica operatur.</hi> Faith then is not to be underſtood as an inſtrument in working or meriting, but as an inſtrument in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and applying of grace and mercy through Chriſt. Faith is our act, and it is our duty to beleeve; but it is Gods gifts; we of our ſelves are no more able to beleeve, then to perform the Commandments. The ſelf-ſame power that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, can onely raiſe us up to beleeve, <hi>Col. 2. 12. Buried with him in baptiſm, wherein you are alſo riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> That we may not reſt as Papiſts do, <hi>opere operato,</hi> the Apoſtle mentions the Authour and Giver of faith. And ſo likewiſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cùm Baptiſmi efficacia ſalutaris à fide pendeat, aquum eſt ut ipſa fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des à ſolo Deo expectetur, nè nobis in nobis detur aliqua anſa glorian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</hi> Dav. in Col. 2. 12.</note> tells us, <hi>Eph. 2. 8. For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Faith is a neceſſary companion of contentment, they both come from God, and where they are, they do (as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is) <hi>mutuas locare operas,</hi> they joyn
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54619:68"/> in a mutual ſerviceableneſs one to another, and as the proverb is, <hi>Vara vibiam ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> ſo faith and contentment joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a mutual aſſiſtance, and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of each other. Thus faith is one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of contentment.</p>

Patience is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> patience; the ready way to learn content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to prepoſſeſs our ſelves with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Who are the diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ſuch as are impatient, fretting and diſquieting themſelves under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens? But ſuch as are patient, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpirited perſons, have attained unto a good proficiency in this choice art of contentedneſs. This grace of patience is of ſingular uſe, for thereby we poſſeſs our ſelves, and enjoy all that we have quietly and contentedly. It is our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Luke 21. 19. In your patience poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ye your ſouls.</hi> And there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of exerciſing this grace of patience, <hi>Hebr. 10. 36. For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe.</hi> As a ſouldiers courage is known in a day of battel; ſo is a Chriſtians patience tried in time of affliction. <hi>Tribulation worketh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and patience experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hope.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Cyprian</hi> that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Martyr, in that excellent book of

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54619:69"/> any croſs thwarting providence, we fret and repine, and are ſo exceedingly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with melancholy and diſcontent? The reaſon is, becauſe we ſet our hearts too much upon the world, and mind earthly things. <hi>If ſin ſat heavy</hi> (as Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Wherefore then let us with all holy greedineſs labour after heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and this is an excellent means to learn the leſſon of divine Contentment. If we account heaven our treaſure, joy and hope, our hearts will be fixed thereon, our tongues will be ſpeaking thereof; even our whole joy, deſires and delights will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and employed about the ſerious thoughts of heavenly things. Wherefore though in this preſent world (as it is the

If we ſhould fancy a perpetuity in an Inn, and dream of an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding happineſs there, we ſhould exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly forget our ſelves. We may apply <hi>Pſal. 49. 11, 12. Their inward thought is, that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.

If we could truſt God and beleeve him to be All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and Omnipotent, and therefore able to help us, and could we beleeve God to be a God of truth, and therefore as good as his word, and could we beleeve him to be a God of wiſdom, knowing how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and order all things for our good, then we ſhould ſoon baniſh out of our hearts all diſcontented and repining thoughts: but ſuch is the great miſchief of unbelief, that it foments and cheriſheth all vexatious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thoughts.

Upon a ſerious review, we ſhall find many miſcarriages, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we have trod many ſteps awry, and are guilty of many deviations and tranſgreſſions from the rule of the word. Notwithſtanding variety of mercies heaped upon us, we have with <hi>Jeſhurun waxed fat</hi>

                     <hi>and kicked.</hi> God hath given us all things richly to enjoy, we are maintained by Gods liberality; but we abuſe ſo great bounty: our clothes which are given for a covering, we abuſe to pride and vanity; the meat and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54619:79"/> drink which are given for our nouriſhment, we abuſe to luxury and intemperance: the riches of the world which God hath given us for our comfortable ſubſiſtence, and for the ſupply of ſuch as are in diſtreſs, we have abuſed to ſuperfluity and prodigality; or elſe we have fixed our hearts ſo ſtedfaſtly upon the pelf and traſh of the world, as if we acknowledged no other God but Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Now then when in deliberate and ſerious meditations, we conſider the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bounty and patience of God ſo freely extended unto us, we ſhall with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs acknowledge the mercies of God in leaving to us any thing of this world to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; for by reaſon of our great unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and miſimprovement of our talents, and abuſe of mercies vouchſafed to us, we have made a forfeiture of all that we enjoy, and it is a miracle of mercy that God takes not the forfeiture, and ſtrips and degrades us of all, and caſts us down into the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hell. Wherefore upon a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our manifold provocations and rebellions againſt God, notwithſtanding the patience, forbearings and long-ſufferings of God exerciſed towards us, we have ſtrong obligations to contentment. The mercies continued to us, are and ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by us, as ſo many cords of love to draw us to this neceſſary duty of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54619:79"/> Let us therefore every one reſolve with himſelf, <hi>Mecum habitabo, I will dwell with my ſelf (i. e.)</hi> let us be more at home, and ſtudy our hearts more, and then we ſhall learn to be content.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Duty is to compare our ſelves <note place="margin">2. Duty, to compare our ſelves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 1. With our ſuperiours.</note> with others, and that with ſuch, who are above us in greatneſs, wealth, honours and promotions of the world. Notwithſtanding their grandeur and riches, conſidering their vexations, diſcontents and troubles, we have no cauſe to envy them; for though many men have great poſſeſſions, yet they can take no content in them, nor enjoy them with any delight and comfort. Great perſons are greater and larger marks often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for their enemies to ſhoot againſt them. <hi>Stobaeus</hi> relates a ſtory of <hi>Policrates,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ferunt ſummos ſydera montes.</note> who gave to <hi>Anacreon</hi> five talents, but he was ſo perplexed and diſquieted with the thoughts of that money, that he could not ſleep, nor any other way comfortably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy himſelf: wherefore <hi>Anacreon</hi> reſtores the moneys to <hi>Policrates,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>were not ſo much worth, as to recompenſe thoſe diſtracting cares which he took for them.</hi> When we take ſtrict notice how many there are, who compaſs'd vaſt eſtates by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and extortion, by defrauding and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumventing others, making their ways by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54619:80"/> force and falſhood, might and policies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing above right and honeſty, we ſhall find no cauſe of diſcontent, or envy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not in their condition: when we likewiſe conſider the turmoils, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles which many undergo, to keep that have got already; we ought ſo far to abandon diſcontent and envy, as to abound in thankſgiving to God, through whoſe mercy we enjoy what we have in tranquillity and peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we compare our ſelves with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, <note place="margin">2. Let us compare our ſelves with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</note> ſuch as are to eſtate and degree far below us in the world, we have great cauſe to be content. How many mechanicks are there, who have not moneys to provide one day before another, &amp; have not a bit of bread before they have wrought for it; yet they eat and drink, and ſleep more cheerfully then thoſe great Perſons, who are poſſeſsed of Lordſhips and Mannours, and thouſands of gold and ſilver. If we would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proficients in this art of contentment, we ſhould not diſdain to go to poor mens houſes, and take notice of their manner of living, and after what way they maintain their families. If we enter into conference with ſome of the poorer ſort of people, we ſhall be informed of remarkable paſſages of Gods good hand and providence for them
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54619:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> and their children in times of famine and great ſcarcity. It is frequently obſerved, that many poor mens children, who fare hardly, look more fat and well-liking then ſome who have great revenues. Let us therefore compare our ſelves with poor and inferiour perſons, and ſee how contentedly they live with a little, and are thankful for far leſs then we are preſent poſſeſſours of. Such a weighty conſideration as this ſet home upon our hearts may effectually (through the grace of God) baniſh from us all murmuring and whining language, and enlarge both our hearts and mouths to be thankful for the mercies which we enjoy, and move our hearts to open our bowels of compaſſion towards all ſuch as are in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and neceſſitous conditions.</p>
                  <p>A third duty is to labour for that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">3. Duty to labour for ſelf denial.</note> grace of ſelf-denial. Contentment and ſelf-denial are ſo near and dear to each other, that they live and die together; inſomuch as theſe are convertible propoſitions, <hi>A ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying perſon is a contented perſon, and a contented perſon is a ſelf-denying perſon.</hi> Self-denial and taking up the croſs are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if there were ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between. It frequently ſo falls out, that ſelf-denial and bearing Chriſts croſs meet in one and the ſelf-ſame perſon. Both
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54619:81"/> theſe duties of ſelf-denial and bearing of the croſs are mentioned in three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, <hi>viz. Matth. 16. 24. Mark 8. 34. Luke</hi> 19. 23. whatever ſavours of ſelf muſt be denied and altogether abandoned ſo far forth, as it ſtands in competition with, or oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt. A great ſcholar muſt deny his learning: a man of wiſdom muſt deny his learning, and a ſtrong man muſt deny his ſtrength; a rich man muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his riches, and a Noble-man muſt deny honours. All that is ſelf muſt be denied, as ſelf-opinions, ſelf-reaſonings and ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; even all muſt be denied for Chriſt. And when a man amidſt the affluence of worldly things can deny himſelf, it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident demonſtration that he is a man of a contented ſpirit; for contentment and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial do keep a ſweet and amicable corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with each other. Self-denial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth and encourageth us to contentment, and contentment prevails with us to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny our ſelves. This ſelf-denial is of ſuch great uſe and neceſſity, as <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Abdicare à teipſo, nè abdiceris à Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Salv. lib. 5. p. 167.</note> 
                     <hi>repudia te, ut recipiar is à Chriſto.</hi> That excellent Martyr M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Bradford</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>whoſoever hath not learned the leſson of the Croſs, hath not learned his A, B, C. in the ſchool of Chriſt.</hi> This leſſon of ſelf-denial
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54619:81"/> if it be learn'd well, it will teach us to bear our daily croſs, both with patience and cheerfulneſs. Self-denial helps very much to humble a proud heart, and to mollifie a hard heart. When one ſtrikes with an hammer upon an anvile it makes a great noiſe, becauſe hard and hard meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether makes oppoſition: and in building, unleſs there be cement and ſoder, there can <note place="margin">Durum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per durum non vult condere murum.</note> be no wall reared up: but if one ſtrikes a hammer upon a pillow, it makes no noiſe, becauſe the pillow is ſoft and yeelds to the blow. Let God ſtrike what ſtroke he pleaſeth, a ſelf-denying ſpirit yeelds ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively and patiently to the blow. And of this root of ſelf-denial, there grows the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Contentment.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Duty is to ſtudy the vanity of <note place="margin">Duty 4. Study the vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> the creature. All things under the Sun are vanity and emptineſs, and fading and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing things; both deficient and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and altogether unable to afford any real contentment and ſatisfaction to an immortal and heavenly-born-being ſoul. Why then ſhould we ſet our hearts upon worldly things? When we graſp them moſt greedily, we graſp nothing but ſmoke, or make an attempt to hold the wind in our fiſts. Hiſtorians write, that the apples of <hi>Sodom</hi> are of ſuch a beautiful aſpect, as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54619:82"/> to invite the beholders to take them, but as ſoon as ever they touch them, they fall into cinders and aſhes. <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives his verdict of earthly things, ſaying, that <hi>they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Omnia ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaria in ſeculo, &amp; uihil veri</hi> Tertull. de corona mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis, cap. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>are imaginary in the world, and contain no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity in them. Solomon</hi> had greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of earthly things then many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have had, yet in that rare Book (which may be called his Retractations) he gives this cenſure, <hi>Vanity of vanities, ſaith the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Conſidering therefore the emptineſs <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1. 2.</note> and diſſatisfaction, the vanity and deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all created things, why ſhould we then ſo much perplex and torture our ſelves for the want of them; but rather labour to be contented with what we have, then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and waſt our ſpirits with immoderate grief and vexation, for what we want and would have; which if we had, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we ſhould remain diſcontented. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath a remarkable ſaying to this purpoſe, <hi>That whatſoever</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>is born in this old age of the world degenerates, ſo that no man needs wonder, that particular things in the world have begun to fail, ſeeing that the world is now in defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Wherefore upon a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54619:82"/> that the creature is ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and cauſeth much vexation of ſpirit, and is altogether unable to ſatisfie an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul; and ſeeing that we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a great deal of treachery and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in creatures, we ſhould hence raiſe ground of contentment in thoſe things, which we enjoy at preſent, fearing that we may meet with fruſtrations and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our expectations after greater matters. The things in this world are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually compared to bubbles, vapours, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, dreams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and till we can lay any faſt hold on thoſe things, we cannot fix upon earthly vanities. A muſhrom is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly gone. <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd in one night ſprang up and withered. As ſoon as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was glad of the ſhade of the gourd, God prepared a worm to ſmite it. There are inward worms, as the terrours of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſciences, and outward worms of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and loſſes, which may ſoon daſh all our comforts, and ſpoil all our mirth. The horrours of a tormenting and galling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the loſs of a dear and near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deprivation of an eſtate by fire, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may ſoon embitter our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining enjoyments. If then we make reckoning of any certain fruition of any thing under the Sun, we are utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54619:83"/> and account that ſomething which is a meer vanity. We are ſoon at the bottom of all creatures, and we may quickly apprehend the utmoſt which they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and upon an exact computation, we ſhall find them to be but meer cyphers and inſignificant things; ſo that if we ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the vanity of all earthly things, we ſhall the ſooner learn this choice leſſon of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth Duty is to ſtudy the fulneſs that <note place="margin">Duty 5. Study the fulneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</note> is in Jeſus Chriſt: if we get the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and underſtand that fulneſs that is in him, we ſhall ſet an higher price on Chriſt, and value the world at a leſſer rate; we ſhall account Chriſt our portion, and if we can make ſure our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, we ſhall be well contented, though we enjoy the leſs of the world. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>For it pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> We uſually diſtinguiſh, that there is <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo fontis, &amp; plenitudo vaſis.</hi> In Chriſt there is a fulneſs of a fountain; for <hi>God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> Now this fulneſs in Chriſt is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto his children, and they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thereof according to their meaſure, as much as their veſſels can hold. Let us take ſpecial notice of <hi>John 1. 16. And of</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:54619:83"/> 
                     <hi>his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace. Beza</hi> upon this Scripture quotes a learned Authour, and underſtands grace for grace, <hi>Gratiam gratiâ cumulatam,</hi> but upon after thoughts he determines accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the judgement of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Inſtead of the grace of the law which paſſeth away, we have received the grace of the Goſpel which abideth, and inſtead of ſhadows and repreſentations of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grace and truth is revealed by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore if we beleeve (as we ſhould) that there is a fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, why ſhould we vex and diſquiet our ſelves, becauſe we want the things of the world, which are vain, empty, and no ways able to ſatisfie an immortal ſoul? Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed is infinitely to be preferred before all the world: for in him there is fulneſs of wiſdom to councel us, fulneſs of mercy to pardon us, fulneſs of righteouſneſs to juſtifie us, fulneſs of holineſs to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, and fulneſs of glory to make us happy to all eternity. If then in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt we buſie our ſelves with the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulneſs of Chriſt, we ſhall get our hearts alienated from things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and fixed on things above. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Chriſts fulneſs will quickly diſcover the vanity and emptineſs of all
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54619:84"/> creatures. If then a man enjoy very little of the world, and in the mean time enjoyeth a ſacred acquaintance and communion with Jeſus Chriſt, he hath abundantly enough, and therefore he is contented and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he hath made God his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and accounts Chriſt his treaſure, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, even all in all; and ſuch a perſon is a contented perſon.</p>

Gods providences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently prove the truth of his promiſes, and if we (according to our duty) trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up our experiences concerning provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, how in variety of ſtraights and troubles, we have received ſupplies and ſuccours from heaven, and how God hath made proviſion for us, and kept us alive in times of dearth and ſcarcity; ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations ſet home upon our hearts will read us an uſeful lecture of Contentment, and help us to be good proficients in this kind of learning. Are our eyes in our heads? (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith the wiſe mans are) <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2. 14.</note> Do we take notice of providences as we ought to do? Then we ſhould obſerve how Gods providence doth extend it ſelf to all his creatures both ſmall as well as great; God takes care for vegetives: He clothes the graſs, and puts a greater glory upon one lily, then upon all <hi>Solomons</hi> royal <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 28.</note> eſtate. God takes care for bruits. God feeds the ravens: the lions ſeek their meat of God. Though lions be creatures of <note place="margin">Luke 12. 24. Pſ. 147. 9. Pſ. 104. 21.</note> great ſtrength, and greedy after their prey, yet they receive their food through Gods bountiful proviſion. Now ſeeing God takes ſo great care for bruitiſh creatures,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54619:86"/> it is evident, that he takes abundantly much more for mankind. God doth good for <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 45. Luk. 6. 36.</note> all; even the vileſt of men are protected, ſuſtained, provided for, and kept alive by Gods common providence: but as for ſuch as have intereſt in the covenant of grace, they enjoy the benefit of Gods ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, for protection, direction, ſupplies and aſſiſtance; ſo that the good things of the world (which the men of the world enjoy by common bounty and ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) true beleevers receive them ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and Chriſt with them; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying them unto them through the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. Wherefore, O Chriſtian, take a ſtrict ſurvey of Providences, how when thou waſt bewildred and entangled with variety of troubles, and God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thee, how when thou livedſt in a place, where were dreadful burnings, and God hath ſnatched thee as a brand out of the burning; and how in a time of peſtilence, when thouſands fell beſides thee, and ten thouſands at thy right hand, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee thy life for a prey; and in an hard time, when trading decayed, ſupplies were deficient, and not viſibly to be had, then, in that pinching time, God provided for thee, and ſupplied thy wants: make then a catalogue of the merciful providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54619:86"/> of God vouchſafed towards thee, keep them written eſpecially in the table-book of thy own heart, and then upon ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed experience, thou wilt infer theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, 1. God hath delivered, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and helped. 2. God is one, and the ſame merciful God, as able, and as willing to help as ever. 3. Hence is to be inferred, that I will caſt my ſelf upon the providence, and be guided by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and wait quietly for the ſalvation of God. 4. That Chriſtian, who is a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obſerver of providence, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude experimentally with <hi>David, Pſal. 73. 28. But it is good for me to draw nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An eighth Duty is to be much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <note place="margin">Duty 8. Be much in prayer.</note> and frequent addreſs unto the throne of grace. <hi>Samuel</hi> a child of prayer was a child much beloved, and a mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in anſwer to prayer is a very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſeaſonable mercy. The way then to procure this excellent grace of Contentment, is to beg it of God, and to be earneſt ſolicitours for it unto the throne of grace. And although I do not conceive, that at all times one and the ſelf ſame method of prayer is neceſſary, yet it is of great uſe to pour out ſuch a prayer as may conſiſt of theſe three parts,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54619:87"/> Confeſſion, Petition, and Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Confeſſion, Let us confeſs our <note place="margin">1. Let us confeſs our ſins.</note> ſins in particular, with their ſeveral aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; againſt the Law, and againſt the Goſpel: partly by omitting what the law commandeth, and committing what the law forbiddeth. Let us reflect upon our multiplied provocations, how frequently we have ſinned againſt knowledge and conſcience, and againſt many Sacramental Covenants of better obedience. And what deſerve we at the hands of God? and what can we expect for our deſerts leſs then hell and damnation? We deſerve not the leaſt crumb of bread which we eat; neither deſerve we to breathe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon air. The ſerious conſideration of our ill deſervings and unworthineſs ſhould prevail with us to calmneſs and quietneſs of ſpirit: for notwithſtanding we ſuffer very great and heavy afflictions, yet we ſuffer farr leſs then we deſerve. That we are on this ſide the grave, and on this ſide hell, and that we have any thing left to keep us alive in the world (conſidering our many and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold provocations) it is Gods great patience to bear with us, and his great and wonderful mercy to let us enjoy even the leaſt of what <note place="margin">2. Let us joyn Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Confeſſion.</note> we have.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us joyn Petition with Confeſſion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54619:87"/> in our prayers, and let one petition amongſt others be, that God would give us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and quiet ſpirit. This contented ſpirit comes alone from God, and he alone can perſwade the heart of man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and ſatisfied: God can both ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our wants, and when we are ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with variety of wants, give us a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame of ſpirit amidſt them all. The Apoſtle was aſſured, <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need according to his riches in glory</hi>

                     <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> In the beſt of thoſe things which are under the Sun, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lacking; we muſt therefore go to God for ſupply. What is wanting in any creature God is onely able to fill up. All we are and have, comes from God: but that mercy which is given in anſwer to prayer, is to be more valued; for when we can ſay particularly and experimentally, This mercy I ſought of God in prayer, and he hath vouchſafed unto me a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwer, wherefore I will for ever truſt God, and ſtay upon his gracious promiſes, then do we make a right and ſuitable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of mercies. A contented mind is the gift of God: it is worth asking for, and worth having and keeping. O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian! pray earneſtly for this grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and when thou haſt got it, part
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54619:88"/> not with it; but keep it with all care and delight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us with Confeſſion and Petition <note place="margin">3. Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> joyn Thankſgiving to our prayer: For there is not the leaſt mercy that we enjoy, but we have cauſe to be thankful for it. As for our food and raiment, and our daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; for our lives, and livelyhoods, even for all that we have, we ought to be thankful. There is not a bit of bread which we eat, nor a ſup of bear which we drink, nor any clothes which we wear, but for them all we ought to acknowledge Gods boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to us with all thankfulneſs. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence watcheth over us, and all our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſupplies and comforts flow from his gracious hand of providence. Now a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man both in his lips and heart is exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in extolling the name of God, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating his praiſes and ſpeaking good of his name, and telling of his loving kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all the day long; and ſuch grateful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſuppreſſeth all murmurings and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and ſettles the ſoul in a holy ſecurity and peace.</p>
                  <p>A ninth Duty is to exerciſe ſobriety and <note place="margin">Duty 9. Exerciſe ſobriety and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> temperance, in the uſe of all thoſe things which we enjoy; as in eating, drinking and ſleeping, and in the managing of all the duties of our calling, we muſt be ſober and

Neither muſt we deny our ſelves in unlawful things onely (for that we muſt do at all times) but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ought to deny our ſelves in things lawful; by not taking our utmoſt liberty in exacting with rigour our own rights and dues.

Whence comes diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and vexations, and tumultuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of ſpirit, but from intemperance and want of moderation? Could men with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54619:89"/> ſobriety and moderation order all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs (though they had leſſer eſtates, yet) they would live far more contentedly, then greater perſons, who poſſeſs many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tenth and laſt Duty (which I ſhall <note place="margin">Duty 10. As one man we ſhould all drive a trade for heaven.</note> name) is that we ſhould all as one man drive a trade for heaven; that ſo our love, joy, hope, hearts deſire and whole man, and whole converſation may be there. Let us make it our grand buſineſs to mind the great things of eternity. The Apoſtle ſpeaks in his own name, and in the name of all true beleevers, <hi>Phil. 3. 20. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in heaven.</hi> And he gives an expreſs command, <hi>Col. 3. 2. Set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things above, and not on things on the earth.</hi> And it is the command of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 6. 33: Seek firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs.</hi> Wherefore conſidering, that we have an intereſt in the beſt inheritance, which is the kingdom of heaven, why then ſhould we vex and diſquiet our ſelves for the loſs of earthly things? What matter if we want the ſhallow waters of a ciſtern, as long as we enjoy waters abundantly flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the fountain? Chriſt hath made many promiſes to his children, and every promiſe is a debt; heaven will make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54619:89"/> and give a full diſcharge of all Chriſts debts and engagements. Heaven will infinitely compenſate and ſatisfie the loſs of all earthly things: for (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent</hi>

                        <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat aliquid apud ſe ſubductis ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus quoſi collectum firmiter ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere, ac proinde non dubiae opinic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, ſed firma perſuaſionis ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem habet.</hi> Gerrh.</note> 
                     <hi>time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> Upon exact compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Apoſtle found it ſo; or as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Chair he thus determined the queſtion. How then comes it to paſs, that we fret and murmure by reaſon of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are incumbent on us? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our hearts are not above, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: we ſet too high a price on the droſs and dung of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and value not the chiefeſt price (as we ought to do) <hi>viz.</hi> the riches of Chriſt. Wherefore we muſt copy out S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>'s leſſon and learn it throughly, <hi>Phil. 3. 8. Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi> When we can thus ſet a low price on the world, we ſhall learn to ſet a higher price on Jeſus Chriſt. And when our hearts are fixed on heaven where our treaſure is, we ſhall look upon all things under the Sun, as below our cognizance, and too low for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54619:90"/> our affections. Hence then it will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appear, that heavenly-mindedneſs, and a holy converſation will in an eſpecial manner produce contentment and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the mind of Chriſtians; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the things of the world run croſs to us, and all their motions are excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, yet the riches of Chriſt, and the conſideration of the high calling in him, the crown of glory, and <hi>the inheritance immortal and undefiled, that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, reſerved in heaven for us,</hi> will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly content, comfort, and ſatisfie our ſpirits: And thus if we can put thoſe ten Duties forementioned into practice, we ſhall (through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth us) learn the divine art of contentment, and underſtand that excellent myſtery, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> learned and commended to our imitation.</p>

That God is infinitely able to help us, is a ſtrong argument to perſwade us to be contented in all conditions.

A ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd knows his ſheep.</note> knows and diſtinguiſheth them, not onely from goats, wolves and ſuch like creatures; but he knows and puts difference by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain marks between his own ſheep and other mens ſheep; ſo Chriſt perfectly knows all his own ſheep, <hi>Joh. 10. 14. I am the good</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:54619:93"/> 
                     <hi>ſhepherd, and know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi> There is a mutual knowledge of and acquaintance with Chriſt and his ſheep; He knows them, and they know him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another property of a ſhepherd is to <note place="margin">2. A ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd calls his ſheep.</note> call his ſheep. A ſhepherd by a whiſtle calls his ſheep; ſo Chriſt calls his ſheep, by the voice of the miniſtery of his word, and by the motions of his Spirit, and by the whiſpers of conſcience; and Chriſts ſheep hearken to his <hi>call, Joh. 10. 27. My ſheep hear my voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A ſhepherd feeds his ſheep. A good <note place="margin">3. A ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd feeds his ſheep.</note> ſhepherd carries his ſheep into good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and in froſt and ſnow he feeds them: ſo God is the good Shepherd, who makes proviſion for his people. There is a grand promiſe, <hi>Ezek. 34. 13, 14. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countreys, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Iſrael by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the countrey. And I will feed them in a good paſture, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high mountains of Iſrael ſhall their fold be; there ſhall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat paſture ſhall they feed upon the mountain of Iſrael.</hi>

He is the keeper of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and a moſt watchfull keeper. <hi>Pſal. 121. 4. Behold, he that keepeth Iſrael, ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep.</hi> A ſhepherd watcheth againſt enemies: he hath his fold to keep his ſheep in the night, and both day and night, a Shepherd is vigilant; he hath his ſtaff to defend them, ſtill his eye is watchfull over them, leſt they ſhould go aſtray, and their enemies meet with them and devour them; how watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was <hi>David</hi> in reſcuing his ſheep out of the mouth of the Lion, and the paw of the Bear. Above all others, God is watchfull, he is the moſt vigilant Shepherd to defend and protect his ſheep. God promiſeth, <hi>Zech. 2. 5. I will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midſt of her.</hi> And <hi>Jer. 31. 10. Hear the word of the Lord O ye nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and declare it in the iſles afar off, and ſay, he that ſcattered Iſrael will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and keep him, as a ſhepherd doth his flock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A ſhepherd rules, guides and directs <note place="margin">5. A ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd rules and guides his ſheep.</note> his ſheep whither to go. The ſelf-ſame word <gap reason="foreign">

Afflictions are like a ſhepherds dog, which brings home ſtraying ſheep unto the ſhepherd. And this great Shepherd of our ſouls leads us into that way, where he would have us go, <hi>Pſal. 23. 2. He maketh me to lie down in green paſtures: He leadeth me beſide the ſtill-waters.</hi> If then we ſeriouſly conſider the efficacy of this relation, that God is our Shepherd, we ſhould be engaged to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented frame of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider God is our Maſter, and we <note place="margin">3 God is our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> are his family; now a maſter provides for his family, and inſtructs his family, and governs his family.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A maſter provides for his family; thoſe <note place="margin">1. A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for his family.</note> of his houſhold, are ſo many <hi>depoſita</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, and it is the obliged duty of the maſter, to make proviſion for them of his houſhold, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 8. But if any provide not for his own, and ſpecially thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith, and is worſe then an infidel.</hi> Now then if maſters
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54619:94"/> on earth take care of, and make proviſion for their families; how much more care doth the great Maſter of all the world take, in making ſupplies and proviſions for them all? All the cattel on a thouſand mountains are at his command: as abſolute Sovereign Lord of all, he ſends ſupplies, and makes proviſion for all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A maſter inſtructeth and teacheth his <note place="margin">2. A maſter inſtructeth and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</note> family. It is a grand and neceſſary duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon all maſters of families to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all under their roof in the knowledge and ſervice of God: for performing this duty, God highly commended <hi>Abraham, Gen. 18. 19. For I know him, that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgement; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham, that which he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him.</hi> It was the reſolution of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> (c. 24. v. 15.) <hi>but as for me, and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſtands upon record for a pattern of imitation, <hi>Pſal. 101. 2. I will walk</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>within my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> And what purging work he reſolved to ſet upon in his family, is evident, v. 3, 4, 5. This Pſalm Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> frequently expounded to his family, and preſs'd upon them their duties accordingly. Let us then thus inferr, if
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54619:95"/> earthly maſters (as duty binds them) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their families; much more doth God inſtruct his great family. Other inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and maſters of families may err, and teach their families wrong, (becauſe men are fallible and ſubject to errour) but God is the great Maſter and Inſtructer of his family, and cannot err; for he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible. Gods teaching is an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and infallible way of teaching. He not onely teacheth his ſcholars, but can make his ſcholars learn and profit by his teaching. God promiſeth his Spirit, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 36. 27. And I will put my Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my commandments and do them. Gods children have eye-ſalve from Chriſt,</hi> and an <hi>unction from the holy One.</hi> Rev. 3. 18. 1 Joh. 2. 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A maſter rules and governs his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <note place="margin">3. A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his family.</note> A maſter of a family is bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all under his roof, to live in the fear of God. In an eſpecial manner, a maſter ſhould regard the obſervation of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, by himſelf and his whole houſhold, <hi>Exod. 20. 10. Thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter; thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, nor thy ſtranger that is within thy gates.</hi> A maſter of a family, muſt not ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54619:95"/> and incorrigible perſons to live with him; ſuch as will not ſerve God, he muſt not continue in his ſervice. He that is a maſter of a family hath a great price put into his hands, to do a great deal of good; he muſt diſcountenance, and puniſh ſins and wickedneſs, and he muſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the practice of religion, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the power of godlineſs. Now doth a maſter on earth rule carefully and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in his family, how much more doth the great Maſter of the whole world rule and govern all his houſhold? Other rulers and maſters have dominion onely over the bodies of men; but the great Maſter of heaven and earth is the Lord and Ruler over all the conſciences of men. This So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord and Maſter preſcribes laws, and not onely commands obedience, but makes his ſubjects willing to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But as for ſuch as are rebellious, and will neither bend, nor bow to his ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptre, he breaks them to pieces, <hi>Pſal. 2. 9. Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces, like a potters veſſel.</hi> There is no oppoſing of Chriſts government; for who ever rebelled againſt him and proſpered? If then we profeſs our ſelves Chriſts ſervants, let us yeeld cheerful obedience to him, as our Sovereign
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54619:96"/> Lord and Maſter. And having intereſt in ſuch a Maſter, we have greateſt reaſon to be contented ſervants.</p>
                  <p>A fourth conſideration why we ſhould <note place="margin">4. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God is our Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> have cauſe of contentment from God is this, becauſe God is our <hi>Husband,</hi> ſo he calls himſelf, <hi>Jer. 31. 32.</hi> And when a people revolted from God, he would no longer be their Husband, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 2.</hi> It is took for granted (for ſo it ought to be) that husbands ſhould abound in love, and be tender-hearted, and provide for their wives, and concern themſelves in their wives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. O! how ſuperabundantly doth this love evidence it ſelf in God! for he loves his people, and takes care of them, and provides for them. There is an union between Chriſt and his Church, and this is a great myſtery, <hi>Eph. 5. 32.</hi> And the love of husbands to their wives, ſhould be like the love of Chriſt to his Church, which is a tender, ſincere, undivided and conſtant love; and farther, this love is a mutual and reciprocal love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. Love muſt be returned for love, though our love to Chriſt is but like a drop to the ocean, or a ſand to the balance, when we compare it with Chriſts love to us. Hence then will be raiſed a ground of ſatisfaction, and ſingular contentment unto the Church of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54619:96"/> God, for Chriſt is the Bridegroom, the Church is his Spouſe. God accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Husband to his people, therefore he engageth himſelf to take care of them, <hi>Jer. 3. 14, 15. Turn O back ſliding children (ſaith the Lord) for I am married unto you: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion, and I will give you paſtours according to mine heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding.</hi> Thus you have ſeen what cauſes there are of contentment from God.</p>

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:54619:97"/>1. Peace of conſcience is a ſtrong ground <note place="margin">1. Peace of conſcience is a cauſe of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of contentment and conſolation. It is a remarkable ſaying of <hi>Aquinas, melior eſt pura conſcientia, quàm plenum marſupium.</hi> A man from himſelf (as Gods gift) can receive <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quaſi dicat fore, ut quiſquam à ſe actorum fructum percipiat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare cuique ſuarum actionum mercedem 3 ſaepe etiam in hac vita, ſed certiſſimè in altera.</hi> Merc. in loc.</note> ſatisfaction, according to that of <hi>Solomon, Prov. 14. 14. A good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> Now none by his own power and wiſdom can ſatisfie and quiet his own ſpirit; but when the conſcience is pacified, and God is reconciled to a ſoul, there is an inward ſoul-ſatisfying conſolation: compare this with <hi>Iſa. 3. 10. Say ye to the righteous, that it ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</hi> In all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions, and amidſt ſlanders and calumnies heap'd upon us, what can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, but the anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?

Amidſt ſtorms and tempeſts, Euroclydons, and toſſings and tumblings, a God reconciled will bear up our ſpirits againſt all; <hi>Tranquillus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us tranquillat omnia.</hi> But becauſe many pretend to conſcience, who are meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to conſcience, and quiet themſelves with a falſe peace, and content themſelves
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54619:97"/> with a carnal ſecurity, I will make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe diſtinguiſhing characters, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> mentions, <hi>Bona eſt conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>

And what is that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters all the pleaſures in the world, but an evil conſcience? One grain of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil conſcience intermixt amongſt the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and affluence of riches of the great ones of the world, will prove like that wild gourd which ſpoiled the whole meſs of pottage. <hi>Luther</hi> hath a rare ſaying to this purpoſe, <hi>Una guttula malae conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae totum mare mundani gaudii abſorbet.</hi> If then you would enjoy true and ſolid mirth, and an abiding contentment, labour to keep this <hi>Fort-royal</hi> impregnable, I <note place="margin">Hic murus aheneus eſto, Nil conſcire ſibi, nulld pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcere culpà.</note> mean, the bulwark of a good conſcience. This was the Apoſtles grand exerciſe, <hi>to keep a conſcience void of offence toward God and toward men, Acts 24. 16.</hi> Faith and a good conſcience are to be united, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 19. Holding faith and a good conſcience.</hi> If we unite them and hold them faſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we conſult our own peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, but if we divide them, we lay our ſelves naked to the aſſaults of Satan, the temptations of the world, and the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54619:98"/> prevalency of our own corruptions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another cauſe of contentment from <note place="margin">2. The right go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is a cauſe of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> our ſelves, is the right government of the affections: when affections are rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and bounded, they adminiſter great contentment and conſolation. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are frequently to be compared to the ſwelling and boiſterous waves of the ſeas, which keeps neither bounds, nor banks, but cauſe an inundation. The affections are uſually inordinate, extravagant, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and diſorderly, and they ſet the whole man in a tumult: The perturbations and diſorders of the affections ſets all in a hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly of confuſion. But when (through the grace of God) the affections are ſet upon the right object, and diſpoſed in a right order, then there ariſeth a wonderful calm and ſerenity upon the ſpirit. When the love, joy, hope and deſire are weaned from the world, and fixed upon heavenly things, then the heart is quieted and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied. But the diſorder and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the affections cauſeth great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; for when the heart hankers partly after earth, and partly after heaven, there can be no ſolid contentment and acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence amidſt ſuch diviſions and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But when all thoſe affections, love, joy, hope and deſire make God the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum quietativum,</hi> then all is right, for then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54619:98"/> the heart is comforted, and the conſcience pacified, and the whole man ſet in a right frame and temper.</p>
                  <p>A third cauſe of contentment is from the <note place="margin">3. There is cauſe &amp; encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> examples of others: This is <hi>cauſae exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The examples of others may in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial manner (when God ſets them home) prevail with us to contentment.</p>

He was well contented with this mean condition, and when afterwards the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſent for him, and clothed him with ſilken clothes, and perſwaded him to deny Chriſt, he preſently tore his ſilken clothes in pieces, ſaying, <hi>If for theſe you think to have me deny my faith, take them again.</hi> Whereupon he was with ſcorn caſt out. Had this great man been willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt, he might have kept his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dignities and riches; but he preferred Chriſt before all honours, and he was rather contented to be a ſlave to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and keep his camels, then deny Chriſt for the greateſt preferments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as we muſt reflect upon examples <note place="margin">2. Let us look upon examples below us.</note> above us, for our imitation; ſo we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon examples below us, and learn from them, this excellent leſſon of Contentment. From the pooreſt we may learn this leſſon. Such as have no more then what they work for, and can onely reſerve ſomething to keep them alive on the ſabbath day, for which they have wrought in hard labour all the ſix days in the week; theſe, I ſay, eat, drink and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54619:100"/> ſleep, with a great deal of contentment. They are contented with courſe bread, ſmall drink, and ſometimes water, and with a hard bed of ſtraw, and yet they eat and drink heartily and ſleep quietly, and they and their children look fat and well-liking. They have not thoſe cares, fears and vexations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits, as thoſe have, who have thouſands of gold and ſilver. With ſuch as theſe, we ſhould compare our ſelves, and if ſo little a portion content them, why ſhould not much more content us?</p>
                  <p>For a cloſe of this Treatiſe, let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted (and O! that the Exhortation might take good effect) to account God our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, riches, treaſure, and all in all, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, who alone can quiet, content and ſatisfie our ſouls, we ſhall be abundantly qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, contented and ſatisfied. I ſhall conclude all with <hi>Pſal. 4. 6, 7, 8. There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more then in the time that their corn and their wine increaſed. I will lay me down in peace, and ſleep: for thou Lord onely makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi>
